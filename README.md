## Usage

Open `Preferences` > `Taut` for Taut settings:

- Enable or disble plugins
- Edit plugin config or user CSS
- (Desktop only) You can also edit config or CSS in the config folder:
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\taut`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/taut`
  - Linux: `~/.config/taut`
- Desktop enables DevTools, press `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I` or `Cmd`+`Option`+`I`

Change how Taut is loaded:

- Loader:
  - Desktop
    - Menu (on Windows/Linux, press Alt to show) > `Taut` >
      `Change app source...`
  - Userscript
    - Tampermonkey icon while on Slack > `Options`
    - Or, go to [taut.jer.app/options](https://taut.jer.app/options)
  - Extension
    - `Manage Extension` > `Extension options`/`Preferences`
- Options:
  - `Official` - Normal build, always up-to-date
  - `Official (sourcemaps)` - Same as Official, but original `.ts` and `.tsx`
    files show up in DevTools for better debugging, ~250kb more
  - `Dev server` - Loads from `bun dev` running locally on `localhost:3000`
  - `Embedded copy` (only on custom embedded builds) - Loads the copy of Taut
    stored inside the loader

  `user-plugins/` (the `plugins/` directory is overwritten on update)

## Development

Taut consists of a primary [app](app/) (with [plugins](plugins/) bundled inside)
and different loaders (including [desktop](desktop/), the
[userscript](userscript/), and the [Chrome](extension/chrome/) and
[Firefox](extension/firefox/) extensions). An "embedded" loader contains a copy
of the app bundle inside of it, otherwise it is loaded from
[taut.jer.app](https://taut.jer.app/taut.js) by default.

The project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) for development (`npm i -g bun` if you
need it). After installing and building everything (`bun run build`), output
files will be in [`dist/`](dist/). Desktop (much slower than everything else) is
built separately with `bun build:desktop [platforms]` (`win` `win-arm` `mac`
`mac-x64` `linux` `linux-arm`, optional `--embedded`).

PRs are very welcome! You should join the

### Taut Rich Presence

Taut provides a rich presence plugin, which spins up a server that reads from socket at the following locations:

- `$TMPDIR/taut-presence.sock` on MacOS and Linux
- `\\.\pipe\taut-presence` on Windows

Any commands sent to Taut Rich Presence should be in NDJSON format (meaning that any JSON payloads you send **must** end with a newline).

The command structure roughly follows this format:

```json
{
  op: "xyz", // operation here
  data: ... // any data required for said operation
}
```

The following commands are accepted:

- `op: "set"`
  - Set the current user's status. `text` (string), `emoji` (string), and `ttl` (integer) are accepted pieces of data. 
  - Text determines the text of the status, emoji determines the emoji displayed (must be provided in :emoji: format), and `ttl` in seconds determines when the status expires.
- `op: "clear"`
  - Clear the current user's status. Does not take any extra data.
